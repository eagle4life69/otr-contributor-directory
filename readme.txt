A dynamic plugin that displays grouped episode listings by show and year for actors (or other contributors) featured in Old Time Radio episodes.

== Description ==

OTR Contributor Directory is a powerful plugin that allows you to highlight actors, writers, producers, and others from your podcast episodes. Using post tags, it dynamically pulls all related content and displays it grouped by Show and Year â€” with a built-in download link from PowerPress.

Perfect for fans who follow favorite stars or researchers tracking contributor involvement over time.

== How to Use ==

1. Create a new WordPress Page or Post for a contributor.
2. Add the shortcode:
   `[otr_contributor name="William_Conrad"]`
3. To support multiple aliases:
   `[otr_contributor name="William_Conrad,Bill_Conrad"]`

The plugin automatically:
- Groups by Show (based on the root category)
- Breaks episodes down by Year (parsed from the title format MM-DD-YY)
- Includes download links from PowerPress

== Features ==

- Easy-to-use shortcode
- Multiple tag support (for alias handling)
- Grouped tabs for Show and Year
- Pulls from PowerPress for download links
- Dynamically updates as new episodes are added
